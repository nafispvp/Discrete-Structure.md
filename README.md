# Discrete Structure
# Introduction
👨‍💼Lecturer : Dr Tarmizi bin Adam
👨🏻‍🎓Section : 09

# 📝Summary
Discrete Structures is a fundamental subject in Computer Science that focuses on mathematical concepts used to solve problems involving discrete (non-continuous) data. Throughout this course, I learned important topics such as logic, set theory, relations, functions, recursion, matrices, graphs, and combinations. These topics help in understanding how computer programs work logically and how problems can be structured and solved efficiently.

The subject emphasizes logical reasoning and problem-solving skills, which are essential for programming and algorithm design. Concepts like propositional logic and predicates help in constructing correct conditions in programs, while graphs and relations are widely used in real-world applications such as networking, databases, and pathfinding algorithms. Overall, Discrete Structures provides the mathematical foundation needed for advanced Computer Science subjects.

# 🪞Reflection
This subject helped me improve my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. I learned how to analyze problems step by step and justify solutions logically instead of relying on trial and error. Discrete Structures also helped me understand the theory behind many concepts used in Computer Science, making me more confident in tackling complex programming problems.
